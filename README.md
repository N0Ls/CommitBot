Small project project that started as a joke.
This bot automatically makes fake commits for you and increase your GitHub contributions number.

This script is for educational purposes only.
It was made to play around with Node.js.
Tested with 5 commits on this account.


The connection with username/password is the normal process when using the git push command.
The program never uses your username or password.
If you don't trust that, leave the program after the commits are down and use :
``` git push -u origin master ```

# Requirements
